# Weather Forecast Web-App
The OpenWeatherMap API provides access to weather data from around the world.

Before we start, it's crucial to have a basic understanding of HTML ( HyperText Markup Language ), CSS ( Cascading Style Sheets ), and JavaScript. These are the building blocks of web development.

Understanding the Basics == >>
== HTML is used to structure the content on the web page.
== CSS is used for styling and designing the webpage.
== JavaScript is used to make the webpage interactive.

Index.html file, create the basic structure of your web page. This includes adding elements that will display the weather information, such as the city name, temperature, weather description, and icons.

Style.css file to start styling your webpage. Here, we can define the look and feel of application, including the layout, colors, fonts, and spacing. The goal is to make the weather information easy to read and visually appealing.

Script.js file, write the JavaScript code to fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. We'll need to make an API call using the city name or geographic coordinates. Once receive the data, parse the JSON response and display the relevant weather information on webpage.

Enhanced application by allowing users to search for the weather by city name. Add an input field and search button to your HTML, and use JavaScript to update the weather information on the webpage dynamically based on the user's input.

Best Practices and Tips == >>
== Ensure application is responsive and looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.
== Use modern JavaScript features like async/await for API calls to make your code cleaner and more readable.
== Always handle errors gracefully. For instance, if the API call fails or the city name is not found, inform the user with a friendly message.

Happy coding !!
